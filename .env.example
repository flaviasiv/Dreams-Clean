# Environment Variables Example
# Dreams-Clean Website Configuration

# =====================================================
# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# =====================================================
# This is a STATIC website without a build process.
# The variables below are for DOCUMENTATION purposes only.
# They show what IDs are used in the project.
#
# These are PUBLIC client-side identifiers that are
# safe to commit to version control. They are meant
# to be visible in browser source code.
#
# If you want to use environment variables in the future,
# you'll need to add a build tool like Vite or Parcel.
# =====================================================

# Google Analytics & Tag Manager

# =====================================================
# Security Notes:
# =====================================================
# - Never commit actual .env files to version control
# - The .gitignore file prevents this
# - Only this .env.example file should be committed
# - For secrets, use server-side environment variables
# =====================================================
